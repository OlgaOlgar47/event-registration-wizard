### Technical Stack

---

**Frontend**: React, TypeScript
_State Management_: Redux Toolkit  
_Styling_: CSS Modules (module.scss), variables, mixins, styles-nesting, material-UI
_Form Handling_: React Hook Form, Zod  
_API_: Axios  
_Internationalization_: i18next, react-i18next
_Code Quality_: Husky, lint-staged, stylelint

In this project, a modular architecture was deemed unnecessary due to the project's scope and complexity. Instead, a simple and straightforward folder structure was chosen to keep the codebase clean and easy to navigate. This approach allows for rapid development and easy maintenance while providing enough organization to manage the key parts of the application efficiently.
